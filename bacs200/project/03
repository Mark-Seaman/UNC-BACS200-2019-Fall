# BACS 200 - Project #3 - Amusement

## Amusement Page

The purpose of this project is to build a simple page that tells about things that you find amusing.

Select three pages on the internet that amuse you and create a page that contains links to the content. 
On your page, add a heading, description, and hyperlink to the original material.  Also include some image on your
page for each amusement.

When you place your page on Bluehost, make sure that it does not damage your WordPress blog.  Place
your HTML files in a directory called "bacs200".  The page you create should be "amuse.html".

Balance both the business requirements and technical requirements.

Make sure that your page uses a HTML template with valid HTML.

Customize this code for a jump start on the HTML.

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>

        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <title>Page Title</title>

    </head>
    <body>

        <h1>Amusements</h1>
        <img src="https://shrinking-world.com/static/images/unc/bacs200/Bear_Logo.png" alt="Logo">
        <h2>Amusement #1</h2>
        <p>Description ... </p>
