# BACS 200 - Project #2 - Inspiration


## Use Brackets - text editor

Build your files in the Documents directory.  Create the following folder structure

* Documents
    * UNC_BACS_200
        * public_html
            * bacs200
                * inspire.html

Run Brackets from the windows start menu.

Pin it to the start bar for quick start up.

In Brackets use Open Folder to select the "bacs200" folder.

Next time you run Brackets you will come back to this spot.

Create New File, Save as "inspire.html".

Add the following text and save

    <h1>My Hero</h1>

## Caution:  File Names

### Never use spaces in Filenames
* As URL every space is replaced with "%20d"


### Case-sensitive File Names

WARNING:  File names on your web server are case-sensitive while files on Windows are not.

* File names are case sensitive (on Linux)
* Different files
    * index.html
    * Index.html
    * INDEX.HTML
* On Windows these are considered the same

Pay special attention to the exact case of the file.  For example,
"inspire.html", "INSPIRE.html", and "Inspire.html" are all different files.  Your file must
be the first name or your page will not load.  This is the
most common problem that most students will face.


## Test Your Page

Make sure that your default browser is set to Firefox.

Click on the Windows Folder short-cut that points to "bacs200".

Double-click on "inspire.html".


## My Hero

The purpose of this project is to build a simple page that describes a person that inspires you.

The world can be a dark place, and we all need a little inspiration.  Who inspires you to make
the world a little brighter?

Select one historical or public figure.
Describe why they inspire you and what your response is toward them and what they believe in.
Create an article that invites your peers to admire your hero.  Use your persuasion skills to
win others over.  You will be judged based strength of your writing by your peers. 


## Create Good HTML

When you place your page on Bluehost, make sure that it does not damage your WordPress blog.  Place
your HTML files in a directory called "bacs200".  The page you create should be "inspire.html".
The file that you create should be "bacs200/inspire.html".


Copy the page template from my web page at [inspire.html](https://unco-bacs.org/bacs200/demo/04/inspire.html)
Make sure that your page uses a HTML template with valid HTML.  Visit the page and then view source code.
In Firefox this is Ctrl-U.

Customize this code for a jump start on the HTML.

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>

        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <title>Page Title</title>

    </head>
    <body>

        <h1>Inspiring Figure</h1>
        <img src="https://shrinking-world.com/static/images/unc/bacs200/Bear_Logo.png" alt="Logo">
        <p>Description ... </p>
        <p>Description ... </p>
        <p><a href="http://google.com">Learn More ...</a></p>
        
    </body>
</html>
```

Replace all of the appropriate text with your model text.  You can do this with very little knowledge of the
HTML.   Caution: do not disturb the element tags marked with "<" and ">".
