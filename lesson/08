### Seaman's Rules

* Rule #8: Crawl, Walk, Run
    * Do the simple version
    * Add the features that are required
    * Expand on the design


---

### HTML Template
* Doc Type
* Head
* Body


### HTML Doctype
* Start with a document type tag that tells that this is an HTML file.

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
```


### HTML root element
* The top level element in HTML is <html>.   Add both the open and close.

```
<html lang="en">
</html>
```


### HTML head & body
* Add the head and body elements
* Add both the open and close tags for all elements
* **head** holds invisible settings for the page
* **body** holds the visible content for the page

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
</html>
```


### HTML body

* Add some content to the body.
* Add a headline **h1** and a paragraph with **p**

```
<h1>Simple HTML Page</h1>
<p>This demo shows how to create a page that contains a single headline and two paragraphs of text.</p>
<p>HTML is not really that hard.  There are just a lot of details.</p>
```


### HTML Head

Within the **head** we will define the invisible settings that the browser will read.

These settings must be defined

* characters that are used within the page
* size of the display area
* title used for the browser tab label and bookmarks

We will add more items later.  For now we have

```
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width">
    <title>Page Title</title>
</head>
```


### All together now!

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width">
    <title>BACS 200 - Simple Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Simple HTML Page</h1>
    <p>This demo shows how to create a page that contains a single headline and two paragraphs of text.</p>
    <p>HTML is not really that hard.  There are just a lot of details.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```


### Basic HTML Elements
* h1, h2, h3, h4, h5

### h2

```


### p

* Prevents line wrapping

```
<p>Learn why this actually works.</p>
<p>HTML wraps all words together.</p>
```


### a
* Anchors are how you define hyperlinks

```
<a href="learn-why.html">Learn why</a>
```


### img
* Embed an image in the display

```
<img src="dog.jpg" alt="Dog Photo">
```


### ul, li
