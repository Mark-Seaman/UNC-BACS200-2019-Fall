# [Project #8 - TED Talks with Bootstrap](/unc/bacs200/project/08)


## Goal

* Learn how to curate internet content

### Description

This project will teach you how to curate information on the internet.  This 
gives you a professional presence and a voice.

Curating content is an essential part of the new literacy required by businesses.  
This skill will make you attractive to any business.

There are distinct steps that you must go through to be a good curator.


### Curating Summary

* Selection - Pick the content of subjects that you care about.  Over time you 
will become a recognized expert in this subject matter.
* Summary - Capture the big ideas from the selected topic and write a 
report for others.  Include the following items:
    * Title of topic (write a compelling headline)
    * Author (recognize them for producing good work)
    * Photo of author or topic (add appeal to your page)
    * Link to original content
    * Big idea - one sentence intro
    * Three subtopics or supporting ideas (show as bullet list)
    * Why you should care about this topic (this is your sales pitch)
    * Learn More - links to three related topics
* Publication - Post the article on your website.  Think about how to publicize 
your review summary.  Can you contact the author or leave comments on their blog?   
The goal of curating is to build a professional presence and make others aware 
that you are interested in specific topics.  Successful curation will end in 
collaboration of some kind.  Do not neglect this part.
* Sustainable Contribution - Each topic that you post should be a stepping-stone 
to somewhere. Where would you like to go next?  How does this topic lead to follow-on 
topics that interest you?  Every publication should end by thinking about what to do next. 


### Professional Blogging

Blogging is the fastest way that you can be a recognized expert.   
A successful blogger should write at least 10 articles about subjects 
that you truly care about.   Follow the formula of steps outlined here 
and you will be able to claim that you are the author of your own blog.   
This will look extremely good in a job interview.

Note:  If you are not publishing on your blog weekly do not show dates on 
your articles.  This may make your material look old and uninteresting to 
potential readers.  If you are publishing new content weekly then retain 
the dates to show how fresh your content is.

If your goal is to build professional credibility then start by hitting the 
ten postings threshold as quickly as possible. Most blogs never get to that 
level and many authors run out of energy after 2-3 articles.  Push for getting 
ten things done and then you can decide if you want to publish more in the future.
