# Project #6 - Student Home Page

This project produces a new version of your student home page.  

Follow each of the required steps to make sure that your page meets all of the requirements.


### Home Page
* Create a web page at "bacs200/index.html"
* It is recommended that you save the content that you have in the current "index.html" somewhere else.


### Page Template
* Make sure that the page is based on the template of valid HTML

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
    </head>
    <body
    </body>
</html>
```


### Validate Your Page
* At each step make sure that you produce valid HTML
* Use [https://validator.w3.org/](https://validator.w3.org/) to ensure validity
* Add a link to validate your page
* Example: https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https://unco-bacs.org/bacs200/
* Fix any errors


### Page Title
* Add your name as the page title
* Use the title as a headline


### Profile Photo
* Add a profile photo
* Size the image so that it is 100 pixels wide
* Float the image to the right

```
<img src="your-name.png" alt="your-name" width=100 style="float:right">
```


### Create Class Links
* Build a link to the Class Website on the Sensei server
* Build a link to Canvas
* Build a link to your WordPress Blog


### Project List
* Build a table of projects you have completed
* Show the instructions and your solution as links
* Add a link to validate each project page


### Update Your Project Pages
* Many of your project may not validate yet
* Fix all validation errors 
* Note: Project #1 points to WordPress which does not need to be valid since you did not write this.


### Skills List
* Build a skills table
* Show the instructions and your solution images
* Go to the dashboard and copy this information directly from the class website so that you do 
not have to build it by hand.


### Hook up a stylesheet
* Create a file "bacs200/uncstyle.css"
* Link it into your "bacs200/index.html" page
* Put all styles in this file

### Text & Color Properties

* Enlarge headline to 300%
* Make subheads have a "gray" background

### Spacing & Border Properties
* Make table have a 1 pixel solid blue border
* Set margin on subhead to "1em"
* Set padding on table to "3em"
